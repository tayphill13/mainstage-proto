8:10AM - Begin compiling resources, setup plan of action for today.  Drink Coffee

9:00Am - *** Time Warp ***  Had a woopsie and had to clone back down after deleting.  Lost my origin morning commits for today. 
9:15AM - Completing a tutorial from this week about Gatsby and react, reasearching CMS as tutorial uses Contentful.  I was unable to get it to work first try and may try to implement WordPress into my Capstone instead.
10:00AM - I'm having concerns that my product might only support 1 artist and would not have functionality of a larger system - or social platform.  Will have to look more into that.
10:45AM - Plan to begin Coding after lunch, starting similar shell of tutorial project into my own idea and style.  Finishing up morning with learning about some new React libraries - helmet, rich text renderer
11:24Am- Going to learn a little about Netlify before lunch as the tutorial used that to deploy and I haven't looked into it before.
12:15pm - Frustrated by slow progress, need to regroup after lunch.

1:30pm - Examining my diagram and then looking back over my help queue to see whether to utilize that template, or this new gatsby template--Ideally I'd like to use some from both to get the intended functionality.
2:00pm - Checking out the various gatsby starters...  Very Cool starters, but I feel it would be shortcutting a bit too much, so I will go for just the Hello World starter which is the most basic.
5:15pm - Things started to get hairy with my project when I realized that I might have a repo within a repo, may ask for help with that later.  For now, I have some nice/basic styling and some pages I can flip through.  Fell off on my commits in the afternoon when I started coding and felt like I was moving slow.
